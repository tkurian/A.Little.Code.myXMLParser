{"tagline":"","body":"# myXMLParser\r\nThis application takes in an XML file and will create a tree structure for the file. This application uses C# and a bit of XAML to accomplish the task.\r\n\r\n## High-Level Description\r\n\r\n### XAML\r\n\r\nHere we will create a TreeView. This will be used to help us keep track of parent nodes.\r\n\r\n` TreeView Height=\"262\" HorizontalAllignment=\"Left\" Margin=\"24,37,0,0\" Name=\"myTreeView\"   VerticalAllignment=\"top\" Width=\"314\"`\r\n\r\n\r\n### C# \r\n\r\nThe C# portion of this code will open a file dialogue box when the user selects the \"Open File\" button. We will limit the types of files which the user can open to .XML for the time being - although in the future this small application should be enhanced to handle other related file types. We will store the file in XmlTextReader reader = new XmlTextReader(fileName);. Once this is done we will begin to process it. We will also create a TreeViewItem to keep track of parent nodes.\r\n\r\nWe will use a switch statement that will switch on the node type. We will use three different cases in order to manage indicating whether we are currently processing an element, text or the end of an element. The three cases are as follows:\r\n\r\n#### case XmlNodeType.Element\r\nIf we enter this case, then we will need to first create a new TreeViewItem node. If the TreeViewItem we created(to keep track of parents) is not empty, then we will add the new node we created to the parent. If it is empty, then we know that we are dealing with a child element and we will add the new node we created to \"myTreeView\". After we do this, we will check if the XMLTextReader contains an empty element - depending on the return status, we will set the TreeViewItem (which keeps track of parents) to contain the appropriate parent value.\r\n\r\n#### case XmlNodeType.Text\r\nThis case will simply add the value of the parent to our tree structure\r\n\r\n#### case XmlNodeType.EndElement\r\nThe last case statement will recognize we have reached the end of the element and get TreeViewItem's parent item","name":"A.little.code.myxmlparser","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
